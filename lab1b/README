lab1b-client.c:
- This source file contains the implementation of the server that accepts connections from clients via a socket. Poll is used to listen for activity on the socket or from a pipe that is connected to a shell, similar to in lab1a. The output from the shell is written to the socket (encrypted if the option is given). 

Makefile:
- This file includes targets for building the tarball, cleaning, and compiling the executables. 

README:
- This file describes the contents of the project .
