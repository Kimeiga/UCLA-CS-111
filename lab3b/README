Descriptions of included files:

lab3b.py: Python module that implements functions to scan a CSV of a filesystem summary. The module runs block consistency audits, inode allocation audits, and directory consistency audits.

Makefile: Contains the standard default target that copies the .py code into a file lab3b so it can be run with ./lab3b, as well as clean and dist commands.

README: Contains information about the assignment and files included in the submission.

Testing Approach: 

- We tested primarily using the sanity check, which had 22 test cases. 
- We also tested by making our own corrupted CSVs (ie, changing the CSV outputs from lab3a) and seeing if our lab3b output matches what we expected.
